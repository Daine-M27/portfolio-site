                        | I'm a native Charlottean, Air Force Veteran, Father, and Husband. I love watching my kids grow up and teaching them new things. I like to travel whenever I can, and taking my family to new exciting places is always an adventure.
                        | Making digital art is something I have always enjoyed doing for fun, and I'm really looking forward to using those skills to create awesome web experiences for years to come.
                    p My early years were spent in the Boy Scouts, where I eventually became an Eagle Scout. From there I joined the Air Force, and was able to serve my country as an Imagery Analyst and Predator UAV aircrew member. After the Air Force, I came home to start my family and began working on what has become a very rewarding IT career.
